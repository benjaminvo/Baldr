                            <h1>Learning Web Design</h1>
                            <h2 class="toc-element">Chapter 1: Where Do I Start?</h2>

                            <p>The Web has been around for more than 20 years now, experiencing euphoric early expansion, an economic-driven bust, an innovation-driven rebirth, and constant evolution along the way. One thing is certain: the Web as a communication and commercial medium is here to stay. Not only that, it has found its way onto devices such as smartphones, tablets, TVs, and more. There have never been more opportunities to put web design know-how to use. </p>

                            <p><span id="result-1" class="search-result-text">Through my experience teaching web design courses and workshops, I’ve had the opportunity to meet people of all backgrounds who are interested in learning how to build web pages.</span> Allow me to introduce you to just a few:</p>
                            
                            <p class="italic">“I’ve been a print designer for 17 years, and now I am feeling pressure to provide web design services.”</p>
                            
                            <p class="italic">“I work as a secretary in a small office. My boss has asked me to put together a small internal website to share company information among employees.”</p>

                            <p class="italic">“I’ve been a programmer for years, but I want to try my hand at design. I feel like the Web is a good opportunity to explore new skills.”</p>

                            <p class="italic">“I am an artist and I want to know how to get samples of my paintings and sculpture online.”</p>
                            <p class="italic">“I tinkered with web pages in high school and I think it might be something I’d like to do for a living.”</p>

                            <p> Whatever the motivation, the first question is always the same: “Where do I start?” It may seem like there is a mountain of stuff to learn, and it’s not easy to know where to jump in. But you have to start somewhere.</p>
                            <p>This chapter attempts to put the learning curve in perspective by answering the most common questions I get asked by people ready to make the leap. It provides an introduction to the disciplines, technologies, and tools associated with web design.</p>

                            <h3 id="section-1" class="toc-element">Where Do I Start?</h3>

                            <p>Your particular starting point will no doubt depend on your background and goals. However, a good first step for everyone is to get a basic understanding of how the Web and web pages work. This book will give you that foundation. Once you learn the fundamentals, there are plenty of resources on the Web and in bookstores for you to further your learning in specific areas.</p>

                            <p>There are many levels of involvement in web design, from building a small site for yourself to making it a full-blown career. You may enjoy being a full-service website developer or just specializing in one skill. There are a lot of ways you can go.</p>

                            <p>If your involvement in web design is purely at the hobbyist level, or if you have just one or two web projects you’d like to publish, you may find that a combination of personal research (like reading this book), taking advantage of available templates, and perhaps even investing in a visual web design tool such as Adobe Dreamweaver may be all you need to accomplish the task at hand. Many Continuing Education programs offer introductory courses to web design and production.</p>

                            <p>If you are interested in pursuing web design or production as a career, you’ll need to bring your skills up to a professional level. <span id="result-2" class="search-result-text">Employers may not require a web design degree, but they will expect to see working sample sites that demonstrate your skills and experience.</span> These sites can be the result of class assignments, personal projects, or a simple site for a small business or organization. What’s important is that they look professional and have well-written, clean HTML, style sheets, and possibly scripts behind the scenes. Getting an entry-level job and working as part of a team is a great way to learn how larger sites are constructed and can help you decide which aspects of web design you would like to pursue.</p>

                            <h3 id="section-2" class="toc-element">What Does a Web Designer Do?</h3>

                            <p><span id="result-3" class="search-result-text">Over the years, the term “web design” has become a catchall for a process that encompasses a number of different disciplines, from user experience design, to document markup, to serious programming.</span> This section describes some of the most common roles.</p>

                            <p>If you are designing a small website on your own, you will need to wear many hats. The good news is that you probably won’t notice. Consider that the day-to-day upkeep of your household requires you to be part-time chef, housecleaner, accountant, diplomat, gardener, and construction worker but to you it’s just the stuff you do around the house. In the same way, as a solo web designer, you may be a part-time graphic designer, writer, HTML author, and information architect, but to you, it’ll just feel like “making web pages.” Nothing to worry about.</p>

                            <p>There are also specialists out there whom you can hire to fill in the skills you don’t have. For example, I have been creating websites since 1993 and I still hire programmers and multimedia developers when my clients require interactive features. That allows me to focus on the parts I do well (in my case, it’s the content organization, interface, and visual design).</p>

                            <p>Large-scale websites are almost always created by a team of people, numbering from a handful to hundreds. In this scenario, each member of the team focuses on one facet of the site-building process. If that is the case, you may be able to simply adapt your current set of skills (writing, Photoshop, programming, etc.) and interests to the new medium.</p>

                            <p>I’ve divided the myriad roles and responsibilities typically covered under the umbrella term “web design” into four very broad categories: design, development, content strategy, and multimedia.</p>

                            <h4 id="section-2-1" class="toc-element">Design</h4>

                            <p>Ah, design! It sounds fairly straightforward, but even this simple requirement has been divided into a number of specializations when it comes to creating sites. Here are a few of the new job descriptions related to designing a site, but bear in mind that the disciplines often overlap and that the person calling herself the “Designer” often is responsible for more than one (if not all) of these responsibilities.
                            </p>

                            <h5 class="toc-element"><span id="result-4" class="search-result-text">User Experience, Interaction, and User Interface design</span></h5>

                            <p>Often, when we think of design, we think about how something looks. On the Web, the first matter of business is designing how the site works. Before picking colors and fonts, it is important to identify the site’s goals, how it will be used, and how visitors move through it.<span id="result-5" class="search-result-text"> These tasks fall under the disciplines of Interaction Design (IxD), User Interface (UI) design, and User Experience (UX) design.</span> There is a lot of overlap between these responsibili- ties, and it is not uncommon for one person or team to handle all three.</p>

                            <p>The goal of the Interaction Designer is to make the site as easy, efficient, and delightful to use as possible. Closely related to interaction design is User Interface design, which tends to be more narrowly focused on the functional organization of the page as well as the specific tools (buttons, links, menus, and so on) that users use to navigate content or accomplish tasks.</p>

                            <p><span id="result-6" class="search-result-text">A more recent job title in the web design realm is the User Experience Designer.</span> <span id="result-7" class="search-result-text">The UX designer takes a more holistic view—ensuring the entire experience with the site is favorable.</span> UX design is based on a solid understanding of users and their needs based on observations and interviews. <span id="result-8" class="search-result-text">According to Donald Norman (who coined the term), user experience design includes “all aspects of the user’s interaction with the product: how it is perceived, learned, and used.”</span> For a website or application, that includes the visual design, the user interface, the quality and message of the content, and even overall site performance. <span id="result-9" class="search-result-text">The experience must be in line with the organization’s brand and business goals in order to be successful.</span></p>

                            <p>Some of the documents an IxD, UI, or UX designer might produce include:</p>

                            <h5 class="toc-element">User research and testing reports</h5>

                            <p>Understanding the needs, desires, and limitations of users is central to the success of the design of the site or web application. This approach of designing around the user’s needs is referred to as User Centered Design (UCD), and it is central to contemporary design. Site designs often start with user research, including interviews and observations, in order to gain a better understanding of how the site can solve problems or how it will be used. It is typical for designers to do a round of user testing at each phase of the design process to ensure the usability of their designs. If users are having a hard time figuring out where to find content or how to move to the next step in a process, then it’s back to the drawing board.</p>

                            <h5 class="toc-element">Wireframe diagrams</h5>

                            <p>A wireframe diagram shows the structure of a web page using only outlines for each content type and widget (Figure 1-1). The purpose of a wireframe diagram is to indicate how the screen real estate is divided and indicate where functionality and content such as navigation, search boxes, form elements, and so on, are placed, without any decoration or graphic design. They are usually annotated with instructions for how things should work so the development team knows what to build.</p>

                            <h5 class="toc-element">Site diagram</h5>

                            <p>A site diagram indicates the structure of the site as a whole and how individual pages relate to one another. Figure 1-2 shows a very simple site diagram. Some site diagrams fill entire walls!</p>

It usually includes a script and “scenes” consisting of screen views or the user interacting with the screen. The storyboard aims to demonstrate the steps it takes to accomplish tasks, possible options, and also introduces some standard page types. Figure 1-3 shows a simple storyboard. A user flow chart is another method for showing how the parts of a site or application are connected that tends to focus on technical details rather than telling a story. For example, when the user does this, it triggers that function on the server. It is common for designers to create a user flow chart for the steps in a process such as member registration or online payments.</p>

                            <h5 class="toc-element">Visual (graphic) design</h5>

                            <p>Because the Web is a visual medium, web pages require attention to pre- sentation and design. A graphic designer creates the “look and feel” of the site — logos, graphics, type, colors, layout, etc. to ensure that the site makes a good first impression and is consistent with the brand and message of the organization it represents. Visual designers typically generate sketches of the way the site might look, as shown in Figure 1-4. They may also be responsible for producing the graphic files in a way that is optimized for delivery over the Web (see Chapter 21, Lean and Mean Web Graphics for image optimization techniques).</p>

                            <p>If you are interested in doing the visual design of commercial sites profes- sionally, I strongly recommend graphic design training as well as a strong proficiency in Adobe Photoshop (the industry standard) or Adobe Fireworks. If you are already a graphic designer, you will be able to adapt your skills to the Web easily, although this will not excuse you from acquiring a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and other web technologies. Because most sites have at least a few images, even hobbyist web designers will need to know how to create and edit images, at minimum.</p>

                            <p>Again, I want to note that all of these responsibilities may fall into the hands of one designer who creates both the look and the functionality of a site. But for larger sites with bigger budgets, there is an opportunity to find your own special niche in the design process.</p>

                            <h4 id="section-2-2" class="toc-element">Development</h4>

                            <p>A fair amount of the web design process involves the creation and trouble- shooting of the documents, style sheets, scripts, and images that make up a site. At web design firms, the team that handles the creation of the files that make up the website (or templates for pages that get assembled dynamically) is usually called the development or production department.</p>

                            <p>Web developers may not design the look or structure of the site themselves, but they do need to communicate well with designers and understand the intended site goals so they may suggest solutions that meet those goals.</p>
                            <p>The broad disciplines that fall under development are authoring, styling, and scripting/programming.</p>

                            <h5 class="toc-element">Authoring/markup</h5>

                            <p>Authoring is the term used for the process of preparing content for delivery on the Web, or more specifically, marking up the content with HTML tags that describe its content and function. If you want a job as a web developer, you need to have an intricate knowledge of HTML and how it functions on various browsers and devices. The HTML specification is constantly evolving, which means you’ll need to keep up with the latest best practices and opportunities as well as bugs and limitations. The good news is, it’s not difficult to get started, and from there, you can gradually increase your skills. We’ll be dabbling with HTML in Chapter 2, How the Web Works and then discussing it in great detail in Part II of this book.</p>

                            <h5 class="toc-element">Styling</h5>

                            <p>In web design, the appearance of the page in the browser is controlled by style rules written in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). We’ll get deep into CSS in Part III of this book (including what “cascading” means!), but for now just know that in contemporary web design, the appearance of the page is handled separately from the HTML markup of the page. Again, if you are interested in working in web development, knowing your way around CSS and how it is supported (or not supported) by browsers is guaranteed to be part of your job description.</p>
                                
                            <h5 class="toc-element">Scripting and programming</h5>

                            <p>As the Web has evolved into a platform of applications for getting stuff done, programming has never been more important. JavaScript is the language that makes elements on web pages do things. It adds behaviors and functionality to elements in the page and even to the browser window itself.</p>
                            <p>There are other web-related programming languages as well, including PHP, Ruby, Python, and ASP.NET, that run on the server and process data and information before it is sent to the user’s browser. See the sidebar “Frontend Versus Backend” for more information on what happens where.</p>
                            <p>Web scripting and programming definitely requires some traditional com- puter programming prowess. While many web programmers have degrees in computer science, it is also common for developers to be self-taught. A few developers I know started by copying and adapting existing scripts, then gradually added to their programming skills with each new project. Still, if you have no experience with programming languages, the initial learning curve may be a bit steep.</p>
                            
                            <p>Teaching web programming is beyond the scope of this book. JavaScript is introduced in Chapter 19, Introduction to JavaScript (teaching JavaScript could fill a whole book itself). It is possible to turn out content-rich, well- designed sites without the need for programming, so hobbyist web designers should not be discouraged. However, once you get into collecting informa- tion via forms or serving information on demand, it is usually necessary to have a programmer on the team. You may also ask your hosting company if they offer the functionality you are looking for in an easy-to-use, canned service.</p>
                            
                            <h4 id="section-2-3" class="toc-element">Content strategy and creation</h4>

                            <p>Third on our list, though ideally first in the actual website creation process, is the critical matter of the site’s content itself. Anyone who uses the title “web designer” needs to be aware that everything we do supports the process of getting the content, message, or functionality to our users. Furthermore, good writing can help the user interfaces we create be more effective.</p>
                            
                            <p>Of course, someone needs to create the content and maintain it—don’t underestimate the resources required to do this successfully. In addition, I want to call your attention to two content-related specialists on the modern web development team: the Content Strategist and Information Architect (IA).</p>
                            
                            <p>When the content isn’t written right, the site can’t be fully effective. A Content Strategist makes sure that every bit of text on a site, from long explanatory text down to the labels on buttons, supports the brand identity and marketing goals of the company. Content strategy may also extend to data modeling and content management on a large and ongoing scale, such as planning for content reuse and update schedules.</p>
                            
                            <p>An Information Architect (also called an Information Designer) organizes the content logically and for ease of findability. She may be responsible for search functionality, site diagrams, and how the content and data is orga- nized on the server. Information architecture is inevitably entwined with UX and UI design, and it is not uncommon for a single person or team to perform all roles.</p>
                            
                            <h4 id="section-2-4" class="toc-element">Multimedia</h4>
                            
                            <p>One of the cool things about the Web is that you can add multimedia ele- ments to a site, including sound, video, animation, and even interactive games. You may decide to add multimedia skills, such as audio and video editing or Flash development (see the “A Little More About Flash” sidebar), to your web design tool belt, or you may decide to go all in and become a multimedia specialist. If you are not interested in becoming a multimedia developer, you can always hire one. Web development companies usually look for people who have mastered the standard multimedia tools, and have a good visual sensibility and an instinct for intuitive and creative multimedia design.</p>

                            <h1>Learning Web Design</h1>
                            <h2 class="toc-element"><mark class="highlight-green">Chapter 1: Where Do I Start?</mark></h2>

                            <p><mark class="highlight-red">The Web has been around for more than 20 years now,</mark> experiencing euphoric early expansion, an economic-driven bust, an innovation-driven rebirth, and constant evolution along the way. One thing is certain: the Web as a communication and commercial medium is here to stay. Not only that, it has found its way onto devices such as smartphones, tablets, TVs, and more. <mark class="highlight-red">There have never been more opportunities to put web design know-how to use.</mark></p>

                            <p>Through my experience teaching web design courses and workshops, I’ve had the opportunity to meet people of all backgrounds who are interested in learning how to build web pages. Allow me to introduce you to just a few:</p>
                            
                            <p class="italic">“I’ve been a <mark class="highlight-purple">print designer</mark> for 17 years, and now I am feeling pressure to provide web design services.”</p>
                            
                            <p class="italic">“I work as a <mark class="highlight-purple">secretary</mark> in a small office. My boss has asked me to put together a small internal website to share company information among employees.”</p>

                            <p class="italic">“I’ve been a <mark class="highlight-purple">programmer</mark> for years, but I want to try my hand at design. I feel like the Web is a good opportunity to explore new skills.”</p>

                            <p class="italic">“I am an <mark class="highlight-purple">artist</mark> and I want to know how to get samples of my paintings and sculpture online.”</p>
                            
                            <p class="italic"><mark class="highlight-purple">“I tinkered with web pages in high school</mark> and I think it might be something I’d like to do for a living.”</p>

                            <p> Whatever the motivation, the first question is always the same: “Where do I start?” <mark class="highlight-red">It may seem like there is a mountain of stuff to learn, and it’s not easy to know where to jump in. But you have to start somewhere.</mark></p>
                            <p><mark class="highlight-red">This chapter attempts to put the learning curve in perspective by answering the most common questions I get asked by people ready to make the leap. It provides an introduction to the disciplines, technologies, and tools associated with web design.</mark></p>

                            <h3 class="toc-element"><mark class="highlight-green">Where Do I Start?</mark></h3>

                            <p>Your particular starting point will no doubt depend on your background and goals. However, <mark class="highlight-red">a good first step for everyone is to get a basic understanding of how the Web and web pages work.</mark> This book will give you that foundation. Once you learn the fundamentals, there are plenty of resources on the Web and in bookstores for you to further your learning in specific areas.</p>

                            <p>There are many levels of involvement in web design, from building a small site for yourself to making it a full-blown career. You may enjoy being a full-service website developer or just specializing in one skill. There are a lot of ways you can go.</p>

                            <p>If your involvement in web design is purely at the hobbyist level, or if you have just one or two web projects you’d like to publish, you may find that a combination of personal research (like reading this book), taking advantage of available templates, and perhaps even investing in a visual web design tool such as Adobe Dreamweaver may be all you need to accomplish the task at hand. Many Continuing Education programs offer introductory courses to web design and production.</p>

                            <p><mark class="highlight-red">If you are interested in pursuing web design or production as a career, you’ll need to bring your skills up to a professional level. Employers may not require a web design degree, but they will expect to see working sample sites that demonstrate your skills and experience.</mark> These sites can be the result of <mark class="highlight-blue">class assignments</mark>, <mark class="highlight-blue">personal projects</mark>, or a <mark class="highlight-blue">simple site for a small business or organization.</mark> <mark class="highlight-red">What’s important is that they look professional and have well-written, clean HTML, style sheets, and possibly scripts behind the scenes.</mark> Getting an entry-level job and working as part of a team is a great way to learn how larger sites are constructed and can help you decide which aspects of web design you would like to pursue.</p>

                            <h3 class="toc-element"><mark class="highlight-green">What Does a Web Designer Do?</mark></h3>

                            <p>Over the years, the term “web design” has become a catchall for a process that encompasses a number of different disciplines, from user experience design, to document markup, to serious programming. This section describes some of the most common roles.</p>

                            <p>If you are designing a small website on your own, you will need to wear many hats. The good news is that you probably won’t notice. Consider that the day-to-day upkeep of your household requires you to be part-time chef, housecleaner, accountant, diplomat, gardener, and construction worker but to you it’s just the stuff you do around the house. In the same way, <mark class="highlight-red">as a solo web designer, you may be a part-time graphic designer, writer, HTML author, and information architect, but to you, it’ll just feel like “making web pages.”</mark> Nothing to worry about.</p>

                            <p>There are also specialists out there whom you can hire to fill in the skills you don’t have. For example, I have been creating websites since 1993 and I still hire programmers and multimedia developers when my clients require interactive features. That allows me to focus on the parts I do well (in my case, it’s the content organization, interface, and visual design).</p>

                            <p><mark class="highlight-red">Large-scale websites are almost always created by a team of people, numbering from a handful to hundreds.</mark> In this scenario, each member of the team focuses on one facet of the site-building process. If that is the case, you may be able to simply adapt your current set of skills (writing, Photoshop, programming, etc.) and interests to the new medium.</p>

                            <p><mark class="highlight-red">I’ve divided the myriad roles and responsibilities typically covered under the umbrella term “web design” into four very broad categories:</mark> <mark class="highlight-blue">design</mark>, <mark class="highlight-blue">development</mark>, <mark class="highlight-blue">content strategy</mark>, and <mark class="highlight-blue">multimedia.</mark></p>

                            <h4 class="toc-element"><mark class="highlight-green">Design</mark></h4>

                            <p>Ah, design! It sounds fairly straightforward, but even this simple requirement has been divided into a number of specializations when it comes to creating sites. Here are a few of the new job descriptions related to designing a site, but bear in mind that the disciplines often overlap and that the person calling herself the “Designer” often is responsible for more than one (if not all) of these responsibilities.
                            </p>

                            <h5 class="toc-element">User Experience, Interaction, and User Interface design</h5>

                            <p>Often, when we think of design, we think about how something looks. On the Web, the first matter of business is designing how the site works. Before picking colors and fonts, it is important to identify the site’s goals, how it will be used, and how visitors move through it. These tasks fall under the disciplines of Interaction Design (IxD), User Interface (UI) design, and User Experience (UX) design. There is a lot of overlap between these responsibili- ties, and it is not uncommon for one person or team to handle all three.</p>

                            <p>The goal of the Interaction Designer is to make the site as easy, efficient, and delightful to use as possible. Closely related to interaction design is User Interface design, which tends to be more narrowly focused on the functional organization of the page as well as the specific tools (buttons, links, menus, and so on) that users use to navigate content or accomplish tasks.</p>

                            <p>A more recent job title in the web design realm is the User Experience Designer. The UX designer takes a more holistic view—ensuring the entire experience with the site is favorable. UX design is based on a solid understanding of users and their needs based on observations and interviews. According to Donald Norman (who coined the term), user experience design includes “all aspects of the user’s interaction with the product: how it is perceived, learned, and used.” For a website or application, that includes the visual design, the user interface, the quality and message of the content, and even overall site performance. The experience must be in line with the organization’s brand and business goals in order to be successful.</p>

                            <p>Some of the documents an IxD, UI, or UX designer might produce include:</p>

                            <h5 class="toc-element">User research and testing reports</h5>

                            <p>Understanding the needs, desires, and limitations of users is central to the success of the design of the site or web application. This approach of designing around the user’s needs is referred to as User Centered Design (UCD), and it is central to contemporary design. Site designs often start with user research, including interviews and observations, in order to gain a better understanding of how the site can solve problems or how it will be used. It is typical for designers to do a round of user testing at each phase of the design process to ensure the usability of their designs. If users are having a hard time figuring out where to find content or how to move to the next step in a process, then it’s back to the drawing board.</p>

                            <h5 class="toc-element">Wireframe diagrams</h5>

                            <p>A wireframe diagram shows the structure of a web page using only outlines for each content type and widget (Figure 1-1). The purpose of a wireframe diagram is to indicate how the screen real estate is divided and indicate where functionality and content such as navigation, search boxes, form elements, and so on, are placed, without any decoration or graphic design. They are usually annotated with instructions for how things should work so the development team knows what to build.</p>

                            <h5 class="toc-element">Site diagram</h5>

                            <p>A site diagram indicates the structure of the site as a whole and how individual pages relate to one another. Figure 1-2 shows a very simple site diagram. Some site diagrams fill entire walls!</p>

                            <h5 class="toc-element">Storyboards and user flow charts</h5>

                            <p>A storyboard traces the path through a site or application from the point of view of a typical user (a persona in UX lingo). It usually includes a script and “scenes” consisting of screen views or the user interacting with the screen. The storyboard aims to demonstrate the steps it takes to accomplish tasks, possible options, and also introduces some standard page types. Figure 1-3 shows a simple storyboard. A user flow chart is another method for showing how the parts of a site or application are connected that tends to focus on technical details rather than telling a story. For example, when the user does this, it triggers that function on the server. It is common for designers to create a user flow chart for the steps in a process such as member registration or online payments.</p>

                            <h5 class="toc-element">Visual (graphic) design</h5>

                            <p>Because the Web is a visual medium, web pages require attention to pre- sentation and design. A graphic designer creates the “look and feel” of the site — logos, graphics, type, colors, layout, etc. to ensure that the site makes a good first impression and is consistent with the brand and message of the organization it represents. Visual designers typically generate sketches of the way the site might look, as shown in Figure 1-4. They may also be responsible for producing the graphic files in a way that is optimized for delivery over the Web (see Chapter 21, Lean and Mean Web Graphics for image optimization techniques).</p>

                            <p>If you are interested in doing the visual design of commercial sites profes- sionally, I strongly recommend graphic design training as well as a strong proficiency in Adobe Photoshop (the industry standard) or Adobe Fireworks. If you are already a graphic designer, you will be able to adapt your skills to the Web easily, although this will not excuse you from acquiring a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and other web technologies. Because most sites have at least a few images, even hobbyist web designers will need to know how to create and edit images, at minimum.</p>

                            <p>Again, I want to note that all of these responsibilities may fall into the hands of one designer who creates both the look and the functionality of a site. But for larger sites with bigger budgets, there is an opportunity to find your own special niche in the design process.</p>

                            <h4 class="toc-element">Development</h4>

                            <p>A fair amount of the web design process involves the creation and trouble- shooting of the documents, style sheets, scripts, and images that make up a site. At web design firms, the team that handles the creation of the files that make up the website (or templates for pages that get assembled dynamically) is usually called the development or production department.</p>

                            <p>Web developers may not design the look or structure of the site themselves, but they do need to communicate well with designers and understand the intended site goals so they may suggest solutions that meet those goals.</p>
                            <p>The broad disciplines that fall under development are authoring, styling, and scripting/programming.</p>

                            <h5 class="toc-element">Authoring/markup</h5>

                            <p>Authoring is the term used for the process of preparing content for delivery on the Web, or more specifically, marking up the content with HTML tags that describe its content and function. If you want a job as a web developer, you need to have an intricate knowledge of HTML and how it functions on various browsers and devices. The HTML specification is constantly evolving, which means you’ll need to keep up with the latest best practices and opportunities as well as bugs and limitations. The good news is, it’s not difficult to get started, and from there, you can gradually increase your skills. We’ll be dabbling with HTML in Chapter 2, How the Web Works and then discussing it in great detail in Part II of this book.</p>

                            <h5 class="toc-element">Styling</h5>

                            <p>In web design, the appearance of the page in the browser is controlled by style rules written in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). We’ll get deep into CSS in Part III of this book (including what “cascading” means!), but for now just know that in contemporary web design, the appearance of the page is handled separately from the HTML markup of the page. Again, if you are interested in working in web development, knowing your way around CSS and how it is supported (or not supported) by browsers is guaranteed to be part of your job description.</p>
                            
                            <h5 class="toc-element">Scripting and programming</h5>

                            <p>As the Web has evolved into a platform of applications for getting stuff done, programming has never been more important. JavaScript is the language that makes elements on web pages do things. It adds behaviors and functionality to elements in the page and even to the browser window itself.</p>
                            <p>There are other web-related programming languages as well, including PHP, Ruby, Python, and ASP.NET, that run on the server and process data and information before it is sent to the user’s browser. See the sidebar “Frontend Versus Backend” for more information on what happens where.</p>
                            <p>Web scripting and programming definitely requires some traditional com- puter programming prowess. While many web programmers have degrees in computer science, it is also common for developers to be self-taught. A few developers I know started by copying and adapting existing scripts, then gradually added to their programming skills with each new project. Still, if you have no experience with programming languages, the initial learning curve may be a bit steep.</p>
                            
                            <p>Teaching web programming is beyond the scope of this book. JavaScript is introduced in Chapter 19, Introduction to JavaScript (teaching JavaScript could fill a whole book itself). It is possible to turn out content-rich, well- designed sites without the need for programming, so hobbyist web designers should not be discouraged. However, once you get into collecting informa- tion via forms or serving information on demand, it is usually necessary to have a programmer on the team. You may also ask your hosting company if they offer the functionality you are looking for in an easy-to-use, canned service.</p>
                            
                            <h4 class="toc-element">Content strategy and creation</h4>

                            <p>Third on our list, though ideally first in the actual website creation process, is the critical matter of the site’s content itself. Anyone who uses the title “web designer” needs to be aware that everything we do supports the process of getting the content, message, or functionality to our users. Furthermore, good writing can help the user interfaces we create be more effective.</p>
                            
                            <p>Of course, someone needs to create the content and maintain it—don’t underestimate the resources required to do this successfully. In addition, I want to call your attention to two content-related specialists on the modern web development team: the Content Strategist and Information Architect (IA).</p>
                            
                            <p>When the content isn’t written right, the site can’t be fully effective. A Content Strategist makes sure that every bit of text on a site, from long explanatory text down to the labels on buttons, supports the brand identity and marketing goals of the company. Content strategy may also extend to data modeling and content management on a large and ongoing scale, such as planning for content reuse and update schedules.</p>
                            
                            <p>An Information Architect (also called an Information Designer) organizes the content logically and for ease of findability. She may be responsible for search functionality, site diagrams, and how the content and data is orga- nized on the server. Information architecture is inevitably entwined with UX and UI design, and it is not uncommon for a single person or team to perform all roles.</p>
                            
                            <h4 class="toc-element">Multimedia</h4>
                            
                            <p>One of the cool things about the Web is that you can add multimedia ele- ments to a site, including sound, video, animation, and even interactive games. You may decide to add multimedia skills, such as audio and video editing or Flash development (see the “A Little More About Flash” sidebar), to your web design tool belt, or you may decide to go all in and become a multimedia specialist. If you are not interested in becoming a multimedia developer, you can always hire one. Web development companies usually look for people who have mastered the standard multimedia tools, and have a good visual sensibility and an instinct for intuitive and creative multimedia design.</p>
